Healthcare Fraud Detection
This project focuses on identifying potentially fraudulent healthcare providers by analyzing claim records derived from inpatient, outpatient, and beneficiary datasets.

Problem Statement
Healthcare fraud remains a critical challenge in the insurance industry, contributing significantly to rising healthcare costs and increased insurance premiums. The objective of this project is to predict potentially fraudulent providers based on historical claims data. In addition, the project aims to identify key factors associated with fraud and analyze patterns to better understand provider behavior.

Objectives
Predict whether a provider is potentially involved in fraudulent activities.

Identify important variables that indicate fraud.

Analyze claim patterns to gain insight into fraudulent behaviors.

Dataset Overview
The data used in this project comprises the following components:

Inpatient Data: Includes information on patients admitted to hospitals, such as admission and discharge dates, and diagnosis codes.

Outpatient Data: Contains records of patients who received treatment without hospital admission.

Beneficiary Details: Includes demographic and health condition data of patients.

Two datasets are provided:

Training Set: Used for model training and evaluation.

Test Set: Used for generating final predictions.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost (or other ML algorithms)

Output Format: HTML (for rendered notebook)
